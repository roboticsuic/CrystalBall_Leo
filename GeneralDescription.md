# CrystalBall_Leo
Create a crystal ball to tell your Future

General explanation:

In this project we will simulate how a "crystal ball" works. The idea would be that people ask a question and then shake the crystal ball and it would give them an answer to that question. Similarly, the idea would be to use the tilt switch as a crystal ball and we would use the LCD (16x2), to show the answer.

LCD: (Liquid Cristal Display) 
The LCD can be used to display alphanumeric characters. In this case we use a 16 column, 2 row LCD. There are 16 pins in the LCD circuit.

Materials:
1.	1 x Rotary potentiometer.
2.	Arduino Uno R3.
3.	1 x Tilt switch.
4.	1 x 10-kilohm resistor (for the tilt switch).
5.	1 x 220-ohm resistor (for the LCD backlight).
6.	About 20 jumper wires.

Note: In my case I used a normal switch (instead of a tilt switch)in the schemes due to the fact that I could not get a tilt sensor.
